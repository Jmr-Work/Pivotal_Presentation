			Board Design with DTECTS & Delivery with DTECTS
	
	An opportunity for relationship establishment as I moved back home was presented and I took a contract with Ergsense for existing design troubleshooting and revision. On review multiple product design requirements were missing which prevented establishment of a path for PoC to product, and the team was unsure how to move forward.

	I identified the challenge and needs, generated a proper framing to communicate the end result for process alignment then began work towards that. My work was successful, establishing a successful framework and methodology to generate a successful result and my work is still in motion at present. I overcame several challenges given this was a senior friend of experience who had stepped out on a limb a bit, and was unsure how to admit or re-align for success
