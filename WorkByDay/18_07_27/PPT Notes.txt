	[2] “When inventor meets IOT”

	[8] Schematic
	  - Clear segmentation and modularization of design
	  - Uniform, consistent layout
	  - Clear labelling with notes
	  
	[10] Library
	  - Uniform naming schema
	  - Consistent, uniform symbols
	  - Complete silkscreen & outline markup
	  - He had taken from a plethora of misc., open source libraries and performed modification with out tracking
	  - To make this co-exist with design practices moving forward I did an ‘orig/’, a ‘ref/’ and then the LBR!

	[11] Board
	  - Clear segmentation and modularization of design
	  - Consistent part selection
	  - Clean selection and placement for external I/O
	  - Design flexibility for future expansion

	[12] Board Layout
	  - This is interesting, sharing a board floorplan without layout, sharing a completed layout for reference

	[12] Firmware
	  - My professional career has spent most efforts and time in firmware and would like to share with team

	Tomm Aldridge, senior management of Labs & IoT Experience, a unique pioneer (20 yrs exp)
	
	Tomm is a visionary, he had the vision. I helped him achieve that. I could see where he was pointed, then established the path forward to achieve that.
      *he was using the wrong stuff
		
      *he knew what he wanted, just didn't know how to get there
